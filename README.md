### Week 1 assignment submisson

#### HTML

<p>In this assignment I used html so build my webpages foundation.</P>

<p>I included my header,footer and nav, Broke my body down into 3 sections and created a class to apply to all 3 sections to set their <strong>VW</strong> and <strong>VH</strong>.</p>

#### CSS

<p>Within <strong>CSS</strong> i created multiple classes such as ".flex-container" "flex-direction-row" "flex-allign-right" etc to allow me to apply my css rulings to multiple ares. This mean if i needed a flex container anywhere in my html i could apply the class to the element being ".flex-container". this also allowed me to apply multiple classes to one element giving me better control of my webpage.</p>

#### Things i'd like to improve

<p>I did apply seperate classes to my <strong> nav </strong> and my <strong> ul </strong>. orginally this set my nav items to the right had side of the screen while maintaining my logo and header on the left hand side of the screen. During working with my html and css and adding and removing other features,
my classes assigned to the <strong> ul </strong> stopped applying and displaying my navbar on the right had side of the screen and instead moved them to the left next to my logo and title.<p>

<p> I also encountered difficulty when applying my background image to my <strong> welcome </strong>. orginally the image would cut off the top 40% or so and only display from shoulder height down. Although i managed to allign the image to sit better as the background, this also left a small white space at the top of my webpage i was unable to correct. Within in this same vein with my <strong> about </strong> section i also
encountered similar image wrapping issues where although the image sits fine on its vert axis its duplicated on the edges along its horizontal axis </P>
