### Week 1 assignment submisson

#### HTML

<p>In this assignment I used html so build my webpages foundation.</P>

<p>I included my header,footer and nav, Broke my body down into 3 sections and created a class to apply to all 3 sections to set their <strong>VW</strong> and <strong>VH</strong>.</p>

#### CSS

<p>Within <strong>CSS</strong> i created multiple classes such as ".flex-container" "flex-direction-row" "flex-allign-right" etc to allow me to apply my css rulings to multiple ares. This mean if i needed a flex container anywhere in my html i could apply the class to the element being ".flex-container". this also allowed me to apply multiple classes to one element giving me better control of my webpage.</p>
